# Password-Generator

## What I need to do…

basically write code for these three functions `getPasswordOptions()`, `getRandom(arr)`, and `generatePassword()`

In order to get started I need to make psuedocode first…

### `getPasswordOptions()`

I need to prompt the user how many characters he wants between 10 and 64 characters in length

I have to think about character types… 

- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Numeric
- Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

That's it? So just collect user's inputs within an object.

### `getRandom(arr)`

This serves to get a random element from an array. Ok I need an array and generate a random index that matches an element of the array and return the value
